Feel free to use blockquotes to highlight important information or quotes relevant to your documentation.

## Code Examples with switch

Here a custom tab component from shadcn ui is used.

<Tabs defaultValue="js" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList className="">
    <TabsTrigger value="js">layout.jsx</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="ts">layout.tsx</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="js">
  ```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'
 
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body className="container">
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
